# Specifications from The Odin Project

1. You should have at least two pages (a homepage and a shop page, which includes your shopping cart). Let a user navigate between the pages with a navigation bar, which will be shown on both routes.
1. To your homepage, you can add whatever you’d like! A few images or information will be totally fine; it doesn’t have to be something fancy. The main goal of the project is to focus on setting up the shopping cart. The homepage is there to practice routing using react-router-dom.
1. On your shopping cart route, a user should see a sticky bar (it can be just a top section as well), which displays the number of items currently in the cart.
1. Build individual card items for each of your products. Also, add an increment and decrement button next to it for fine-tuning. You can also display a title for each product as well as an “Add To Cart” button.
1. Once a user has submitted their order, the amount on the cart itself should adjust.
